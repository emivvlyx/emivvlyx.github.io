<p></p><b><h1>Founder</h1></b></p>
<p>At CooolerThanCoolors, we always give profound gratitude to our founder. This is <strong><em>Lemon P. Cat.</em></strong></p>


<h2>Meet Lemon</h2>
<p>Lemon P. Cat has been dreaming about his own world since 476 B.C.E., where he watched the tragic fall of the Roman empire and decided to build his own cat empire. At just 200 years old, Lemon succeeded in building a kingdom of cats, establishing himself as the king.</p>
<p>Although he has been hugely successful in his life, there was nothing Lemon valued more than helping people discover the world of colors. After realizing that some people didn't even know the names of colors, he named his favorite color after himself, which is shown below.</p>

<p><b><h4><em>Lemon P. Cat looking very interested in the camera</b></em></h4></p>
<p>After Lemon finished cativersity, he took things into his own paws. Now, we are presented with a website of colors made by our king and savior, Lemon P. Cat.</p>
<p>However, the creator of Coolors decided to sue Lemon for <b><em>1,000 pounds</em></b> of cat yogurt because they claimed he copied their idea. But the great Lemon P. Cat, who will not give up his cat yogurt so easily, fought and won in court. At the end, Coolors decided it wasn't worth it and even paid him a year's supply of fish soup!</p>
<p>Thankfully, the case against Coolors ended about 20 years ago. However, <b>no users of Coolors will be allowed on this website</b> for the good of everyone, especially our founder Lemon.</p>
<h2>"When life gives you Lemon, pet him. You don't know how long it will be until he comes to you again, in his kingly presence." <b>-Gez Xyz</b></h2>

<p><b>Blackberry O. Bird (B.O.B.)</b></p>
<p><b><em>Lime A. Cat (father)</em></b></p>
<p><b><em>Clementine C. Cat (mother)</em></b></p>
